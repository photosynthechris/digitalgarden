The Cámawood (from the [[BTS Building/Languages/Elvish\|Elvish]] _Cáma_, meaning "guilt"), is a cursed woodland in the [[Locations/Auzora/Greying Wildlands\|Greying Wildlands]], historically known as the [[Veluthil Forest\|Veluthil Forest]].

Description The Cámawood is a cursed forest in the [[Locations/Auzora/Greying Wildlands\|Greying Wildlands]]. Formally green, the vegetation is now an ashen grayish-red color that gives off a sense of decay, and the source of its life and color is unnatural. Through the forest appears to be dead, it is still living and "brims with health" in an off-putting manner, with the wood of the trees moving and shifting slightly even after being cut, if only for a short time. The ground seems dead, but there is a wildlife, which seems to be in a symbiotic relationship with the forest. The Cámawood is dangerous, increasingly so as one travels deeper into it.

History Previously known as the [[Veluthil Forest\|Veluthil Forest]], the forest came to be known as the Cámawood after the corruption of [[Locations/Auzora/Andruin\|Andruin]] and the rest of the forest in 585 PD, becoming cursed for many centuries. The city had been built within the forest on a "powerful natural magic font, a deep-set well of power" which its inhabitants did not entirely understand. At the time of the disaster, explorations beneath the city were uncovering an increasingly deep series of caverns from which the power seemed to origincate, a crystal well of chaotic and expanding magical potential, and while some saw it as a divine blessing of the [[Arch Heart\|Arch Heart]], others thought it may have been an arcane creation that fell from a pre-[[Calamity\|Calamity]] floating city.

The superstition and mythology around the Cámawood have allowed the city of [[Deadfall\|Deadfall]] to prevent the [[Locations/Auzora/Tundraal Empire/Tundraal Empire\|Tundraal Empire]]'s encroachment by using the forest as a defensive position against incursions. Eventually the [[Locations/Auzora/Tundraal Empire/Tundraal Empire\|Empire]] just gave up, and let the region stay independent.

The Skull of [[Jourrael\|Jourrael]] was entrusted to the [[BTS Building/Races/Elf\|elves]] of [[Veluthil Forest\|Veluthil]] and may remain buried and forgotten within the wood.
